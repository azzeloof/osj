<h1>User Guidelines</h1>
<p>Adapted from the Wordpress User Guidelines on April 17th, 2022, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.</p>
<p><i>OpenJewelry is currently in the early stages of an Alpha test. That means that not all features are currently implemented. These sections are left in to reference things that may be added to the website in the future, and the appropriate sections will be revised when needed.</i></p>
<p>The OpenJewelry team strongly believes in freedom of speech. We have a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them. That being said, there are a few categories of content and behavior that we don’t permit because we consider them harmful to the community.</p>
<p>To be transparent about what is and isn’t allowed on our site, we’ve put together this set of guidelines. The following activity/material isn’t allowed on OpenJewelry.</p>
<hr/>

<h3>Illegal content and conduct.</h3>
<p>Self-explanatory.</p>

<h3>Intellectual property infringement.</h3>
<p>If you’re not sure, a good rule of thumb is to always ask the rights holder for permission before republishing their content.</p>

<h3>Pornography.</h3>
<p>We know that there may be different definitions of this, but generally, we define pornography as visual depictions of sexually explicit acts. Nudity, in and of itself, is fine.</p>

<h3>Technologically harmful content.</h3>
<p>Please don’t upload or link to malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious or destructive code.</p>

<h3>Impersonation.</h3>
<p>Don’t claim to be a person or organization you’re not. (Parody and satire are ok though!)</p>

<h3>Directly threatening material.</h3>
<p>Do not post direct and realistic threats of violence. That is, you cannot post a genuine call for violence—or death—against an individual person, or groups of persons. This doesn’t mean that we’ll remove all hyperbole or offensive language.</p>

<h3>Posting private information.</h3>
<p>Don’t share someone’s personal information without their consent. This includes collecting sensitive information in Contact Forms such as account passwords and credit card numbers, to name a couple.</p>

<h3>Advertising.</h3>
<p>Advertising isn’t permitted.</p>

<h3>Hotlinking to OpenJewelry</h3>
<p>You may not use OpenJewelry to host files so they can be downloaded via other sites</p>

<h3>Spam or machine-generated content.</h3>
<p>You know what this is, but in general, sites such as those primarily dedicated to drive traffic to third party sites, boost SEO, phish, spoof, or promote affiliate marketing aren’t cool. We don’t want you to pollute the web outside of OpenJewelry either, so we ask you to please avoid sending unwanted or unsolicited promotions or emails about your content.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Bear in mind that these are just guidelines — <b>interpretations are solely up to us</b>. These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.</p>

<p>If you believe content has violated our Terms of Service or any of these policies, please report the site. We aim to promptly review and investigate all complaints that we receive, but if and how we respond will depend on a variety of factors, such as the information available to us and the type of violation. We may also contact the site owner to inform him/her of the complaint.</p>
