<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Adapted from the Wordpress Privacy Policy on April 17th, 2022, licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.</p>
<p><i>OpenJewelry is currently in the early stages of an Alpha test. That means that not all features are currently implemented — for example, this document makes references to advertising on the OpenJewelry website, which does not actually happen currently. These sections are left in to reference things that may be added to the website in the future, and the appropriate sections will be revised when needed.</i></p>

<h2>Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h2>
<p>Hello there! We are the creators of OpenJewelry, and we believe in open-source hardware and software. That's why we made a website for distributing open-source jewelry designs, that's why we built it using open-source frameworks (and released all of our code on GitHub), and why we even copied this Privacy Policy from the wonderful folks over at Automattic (the creators of Wordpress). This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use the OpenJewelry website, located at open.jewelry (and any associated subdomains).</p>

<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our websites and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>

<h2>Creative Commons Sharealike License</h2>
<p>We've decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike license</a>. You can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on <a href="https://github.com/azzeloof/osj">GitHub</a>. You're more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we'd appreciate a credit and link to OpenJewelry (and the original creators of the policy, <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">Automattic</a>) somewhere on your site.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let's go over the information that we collect.</p>

<h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
<p>It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Basic account information:</b> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for an OpenJewelry account to provide an email address and password, along with a username and name — and that's it. You may provide us with more information to fill out your profile — like a personal description and a profile photo — but we don't require that information to create an OpenJewelry account.</li>
    <li><b>Public profile information:</b> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have an OpenJewelry account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or a description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>
    <li><b>Content information:</b> You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a jewelry post, article, comment, or forum post that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).</li>
    <li><b>Communications with us (hello there!):</b> You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our team about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, OpenJewelry comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Log information:</b> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your content on OpenJewelry.</li>
    <li><b>Usage information:</b> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that users perform on OpenJewelrt — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [OpenJewelry username] deleted “[title of jewelry piece]” at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, downloads, etc.) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.</li>
    <li><b>Location information:</b> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
    <li><b>Interactions with other users' content:</b> We collect some information about your interactions with other users' sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your “Likes” and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, recommend posts we think may interest you.</li>
    <li><b>Information from cookies and other technologies:</b> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. OpenJewelry uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>
<p>We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Third Party Login:</b> If you create or log in to your OpenJewelry account through another service (like Google) we'll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address).</li>
    <li><b>Social Sharing Services:</b> If you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Sharing feature, we'll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.</p>

<h2>How and Why We Use Information</h2>
<h3>Purposes for Using Information</h3>
<p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>To provide our Services.</b> For example, to set up and maintain your account and to host your uploaded content.</li>
    <li><b>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</b> For example, by providing automatic website updates and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.</li>
    <li><b>To place and manage ads in our advertising program.</b> For example, to place ads on OpenJewelry as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.</li>
    <li><b>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</b> For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of OpenJewelry and others, which may result in us, for example, terminating Services.</li>
    <li><b>To fix problems with our Services.</b> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.</li>
    <li><b>To customize the user experience.</b> For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services and recommending content through post suggestions.</li>
    <li><b>To communicate with you.</b> For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on the OpenJewelry project; If you don't want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we'll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h3>
<p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on.</p>

<h2>Sharing Information</h2>

<h3>How We Share Information</h3>
<p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below, as well as in the section called Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</b> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>
    <li><b>Third-party vendors:</b> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like sending you emails); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.</li>
    <li><b>Legal and regulatory requirements:</b> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
    <li><b>To protect rights, property, and others:</b> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the OpenJewelry team, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
    <li><b>Business transfers:</b> In connection with any merger, sale of assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of OpenJewelry property by another company, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><b>With your consent:</b> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Share feature.</li>
    <li><b>Aggregated or de-identified information:</b> We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
    <li><b>Published support requests:</b> If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a policy that we do not sell our users' data. We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.</p>

<h3>Information Shared Publicly</h3>
<p>Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly. That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on OpenJewelry are all available to others — and we hope they get a lot of views! Your profile photo, if you choose to upload one, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the posts,comments, and “Likes” that you make on OpenJewelry while logged in to your account. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.</p>

<h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>
<p>We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we're not legally required to keep it. When you delete content you have posted on OpenJewelry, such as an image or post, it is deleted, but may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

<h2>Choices</h2>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Limit the information that you provide:</b> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information and profile information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.</li>
    <li><b>Opt out of marketing communications:</b> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
    <li><b>Set your browser to reject cookies:</b> At this time, OpenJewelry does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using OpenJewelry, with the drawback that certain features of OpenJewelry may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
    <li><b>Opt out of our internal analytics program:</b> You can do this through your user settings. By opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you're logged in to your OpenJewelry account. </li>
    <li><b>Close your account:</b> You can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests, or simply retained in a server or database backup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>

<h3>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
<p>If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
    <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
    <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
    <li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
    <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>

<h3>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h3>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>
    <li>Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);</li>
    <li>Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services);</li>
    <li>Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);</li>
    <li>Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one); and</li>
    <li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the Information We Collect section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section. If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;</li>
    <li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>
    <li>Opt out of any sale of personal information; and</li>
    <li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA</li>
</li>

<h3>Contacting Us About These Rights</h3>
<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren't able to or you'd like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to “Contact” to, well, find out how to contact us. When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we'll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.</p>

<h2>How to Reach Us</h2>
<p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please contact us via the email address listed on our website.</p>

<h2>Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)</h2>
<h3>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver ads that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by OpenJewelry and does not cover the collection of information by any third-party advertisers or analytics providers.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, OpenJewelry may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. The OpenJewelry team encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice. Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.</p>

<h3>Translation</h3>
<p>Our Privacy Policy was originally written in English (US). We may translate it into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of our Privacy Policy and the English version, the English version will control. That's it! Thanks for reading.</p>
